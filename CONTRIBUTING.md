## Options to contribute

### Issues for documentation, ideas, bugs, and feedback

You can explore or create [issues](https://github.com/didoesdigital/typey-type/issues) to track ideas, enhancements, or bugs. Use issues to track:

- Missing documentation
- Ideas for enhancements
- Bugs
- Feedback about how you learn stenography

Before creating an issue, search existing [issues](https://github.com/didoesdigital/typey-type/issues) to see if any relevant issues already exist.

### Lessons and dictionaries

See the [steno-dictionaries](https://github.com/didoesdigital/steno-dictionaries) project to learn more about fixing misstrokes in Typey Type dictionaries.

See the [Typey Type CLI](https://github.com/didoesdigital/typey-type-cli) project to learn more about contributing lessons and dictionaries.

You can also add lessons directly to the communityâ€™s lessons spreadsheet. See [Typey Type lessons](https://didoesdigital.com/typey-type/lessons) to learn more.

### Steno layouts for other languages

See the [typey-type-stenoboard-diagram-svg-to-react](https://github.com/didoesdigital/typey-type-stenoboard-diagram-svg-to-react) project to learn more about contributing alternative steno layouts, such as Palantype.

## Design

Stenography has a steep learning curve so itâ€™s important that every feature is designed with lots of consideration given to usability. This includes optimising designs for a learnable, efficient, memorable, and satisfying experience with minimal errors.

All features are designed before development.

## Accessibility

Thereâ€™s a proud tradition of blind stenographers. Typey Type is built with visual impairments and blindness in mind, and is regularly tested with a screen reader (frequently using VoiceOver on macOS in Safari and occasionally using NVDA on Windows in Edge).

Typey Type aims for the AA standard of accessibility outlined in the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

Each page is tested for accessibility violations using [axe: Accessibility for Development Teams](https://www.deque.com/axe/).

## Responsiveness

Typey Type is optimised for desktop devices that support Plover. It is minimally responsive, ensuring that content pages are readable on small screens and flashcards work on iOS, Android, and other mobile devices. It also maintains cross-browser support for the latest versions of modern browsers, such as Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.

## Privacy

Typey Type respects peopleâ€™s privacy. This includes adhering to the privacy policy and not recording sensitive data. For example, Typey Type does not send words in custom lessons to analytics in case people are using custom lessons to practise typing passwords and the like.

## Development

If you like to code, you might want to:

- Find an open issue to tackle. If itâ€™s your first contribution to open-source code, see if there are any [open issues with the label, `good first issue`](https://github.com/didoesdigital/typey-type/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
- Ask if you can help write a new feature.
- Improve tooling and testing.
- Review code on other peopleâ€™s Pull Requests.

For new code contributions, consider the following:

- Design, accessibility, responsiveness, and privacy.
- Security.
- Check the browser console for errors.
- Check the terminal for errors and warnings.
- Check that the tests all pass.
- Consider creating additional tests.

### Open issues before Pull Requests

For significant features, please create or check if there is an open issue and wait for a response before creating a Pull Request. Issues may include designs and discussion of approaches.
