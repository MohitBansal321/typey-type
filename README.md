# Typey Type for Stenographers

**Typey Type** is a free typing app designed for steno students to practise and master stenography.

## What's stenography?

The process of writing shorthand is called stenography. Using a stenotype machine or a fancy keyboard, you can write over 200 words per minute. Typically, steno is used for courtroom reporting, closed captioning, and real-time translation. As a means of entering text, itâ€™s also an excellent ergonomic alternative to typing with a QWERTY keyboard.

## Aim

The aim of Typey Type is to fast-track learning and mastering steno skills. Typey Type helps novice stenographers by giving them:

- immediate feedback on typing speed and accuracy
- progress updates, including progress on brief vocabulary
- a course to follow, including material to type
- links to more information
